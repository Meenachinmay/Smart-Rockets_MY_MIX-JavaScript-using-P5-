# Smart-Rockets_MY_MIX
This project is written in JavaScript using P5 framework.and in this project i have shown a simple demo of genetic algorithm so how can some autonomouse agent can use genetic algorithm technique to make them self much smart and smarter with every new generation in they will evolve with time.so there will be many generation of smart rockets and in every new generation the new evolved rockets would be much smarter than previous one so they will able to find out their way by them self without any external help.i also used a small concept of Reinforcement learning which is basically a branch of Machine learning and do work on the concept of learning by doing.
